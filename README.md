Sleep Cycle Flight Planner ‚úàÔ∏èüí§

-----------------------------------
Sleep Cycle Flight Planner is a web application designed to help travelers optimize their sleep schedules during flights. By entering your departure and arrival times, along with the airports you‚Äôre traveling between, the app calculates the best times to sleep or stay awake, ensuring you sync with the destination's time zone. This helps minimize jet lag and allows you to adjust smoothly to the local time at your destination.

-----------------------------------

Features
- Flight Sleep Schedule Calculation: Provides suggestions on when to sleep during your flight to best adjust to the destination's time zone.
- Airport Data Integration: Uses real-world airport data to calculate timezone differences.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI to input flight details.
- Data Persistence: Stores flight information using AWS DynamoDB for future reference.

-----------------------------------

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- AWS SDK: Ensure you have AWS credentials configured if you plan to use DynamoDB.
- React: Basic understanding of React for frontend development.
